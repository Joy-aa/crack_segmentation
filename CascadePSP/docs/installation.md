# Installation

## Dependencies

CascadePSP is tested on PyTorch 1.0 though higher version would likely work for inference as well.
For installing PyTorch, please refer to the [Pytorch website](https://pytorch.org/).  

We recommend using the anaconda distribution which should contain most of the required dependencies. Other dependencies can be installed by:

``` bash
pip install progressbar2
conda install cv2
```
You would also need `tensorboard` for logging.
